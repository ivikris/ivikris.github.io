  "faqQuestion1": "When was the test performed?",
  "faqAnswer1": "Between 2003 and 2006, we collected data in more than 250 settlements. We examined more than 25,000 children aged 3–18 years.",
  "faqQuestion2": "Are the data from the 2003-2006 study outdated, can they be used to assess the developmental status of children in 2020?",
  "faqAnswer2": "Growth tests are usually repeated after 20 years in a population to eliminate the effects of secular growth changes. The 3rd National Growth Survey will be launched in 2023, organized by the Department of Anthropology of Eötvös Loránd University, in cooperation with the staff of Hungarian anthropological institutes and workshops.",
  "faqNKIQuestion2_9": "Why is it so rare in the international context that research following the growth, development and growth of a child from birth to the age of 18 is carried out on a nationally representative sample? ",
  "faqNKIAnswer2_9": "Because only the planning, preparation, organization and continuous monitoring and follow-up of the research, the collection, processing, analysis and publication of the partial results from time to time, until the actual completion of the measurements, studies, professional takes about 20 years.",
  "faqQuestion3": "If I can't find data on a body size in the software, does that also mean that there isn't any data on it between 2003 and 2006?",
  "faqAnswer3_1": "Body sizes not included in the software, but included in the data collection during the study (for which reference series are available on the website of the Department of Theology of Eötvös Loránd University, ",
  "faqAnswer3_2": "http://antropologia.elte.hu/onv_e.html",
  "faqAnswer3_3": "): \nLength body dimensions: seat height, torso length, upper limb length, lower limb length, limb segment lengths (upper arm length, forearm length, arm length, thigh length, lower leg length, leg length). \nWidth body dimensions: torso width dimensions (shoulder and hip width, chest width and depth), limb width dimensions (elbow, wrist, knee, ankle and leg width). \nPerimeter body dimensions: torso circumferential dimensions (waist circumference, upper arm circumference - stretched and bent, forearm circumference, wrist circumference, hand circumference, thigh circumference - thigh and midfoot, lower leg circumference, ankle circumference). \nSkin fold thicknesses (bicep fold, medial thigh fold, lower leg fold). \nHungarian reference series of body component components have also been prepared and are available.",
  "faqQuestion4": "Does the software include domestic reference series of sexual maturation?",
  "faqAnswer4_1": "No, but in the 2nd National Growth Survey we also examined the sexual development of the participants, the sexual maturity status of menarche resp. estimated on the basis of the presence or absence of spermarche and the state of development of the secondary traits. The reference series of these sexual maturity indicators are also available on the website of the Department of Anthropology of Eötvös Loránd University (",
  "faqAnswer4_2": "http://antropologia.elte.hu/onv_e.html",
  "faqAnswer4_3": ").",
  "faqQuestion5": "In addition to physical development indicators, what other indicators that help to assess biological status were examined in the 2nd National Growth Survey?",
  "faqAnswer5": "In addition to indicators of physical development, data were collected:\n-\tblood pressure parameters, \n-\trespiratory function parameters, \n-\tindicators of mental health and psychosomatic development, \n-\tdomestic characteristics of lifestyle factors for children and adolescents; \n-\tand environmental, lifestyle, health behavioral factors influencing body composition, nutrition and health.",
  "faqQuestionExtra": "Why could a \"-\" sign be there in the tables?",
  "faqAnswerExtra": "Indicates a missing value. When you are adding a new measurement to the child, you can leave the input field blank. If you want to replace the missing value later, you can do so by clicking on the pencil icon for that row in the measurement data table.",
  "faqNKIQuestion1": "When was the test performed?",
  "faqNKIAnswer1": "In the The Hungarian Longitudinal Growth Study, neonates born in a nationally representative sample area in the world in 1980-1983 were followed up. (The measurements were carried out by the nurses all the time, with a method and measuring instruments in accordance with international professional standards. I described the measuring points and used the measuring instruments individually and individually). The reference data set for the nationally representative research program included 2 990 boys and 2 703 girls at birth. The data collection and measurement phase of the research was completed in 2001, with the 18-year-olds born in 1980 being measured. At 18 years of age, we examined 516 boys and 520 girls in its reference dataset.",
  "faqNKIQuestion2": "Are the data from the 1980-2001 survey outdated today? Are they suitable for monitoring and judging the tendency of children's physical development, growth velocity and nutrition even in the years 2020-30?",
  "faqNKIAnswer2": "Follow-up (longitudinal) growth studies, if from birth to 18 years of age or the target age, manage to retain a sufficient number of the sample of respondents, in addition to the necessary drop-outs, sufficient to ensure a national level of representation, they cannot be used until adequate results from a follow-up study of another age group are available.",

  "helpTitle2": "1. Settings",
  "helpText2": "The application settings can be accessed by clicking on the gear. Light or dark background colors can be set in the user interface. The user can choose between Hungarian or English language.\nFor the analyzes, the program uses two data sets as reference data. This can be selected on the \"Misc\" tab by clicking on \"Reference Data\".\nThe first study was carried out by the Hungarian Demographic Research Institute between 1980 and 2001, entitled The Hungarian Longitudinal Growth Study. Data collection followed the development data of the nationally representative sample from the birth of the child to the age of 18 years. The application abbreviates this as “NKI”.\nOn the other hand, the 2nd National Growth Survey carried out by the Department of Anthropology of Eötvös Loránd University between 2003 and 2006, which included cross-sectional data of 3-18 year olds. These reference data are abbreviated as “ELTE”.\nWhen selecting the NKI reference data, the “SGA-AGA-LGA for Z-Scores” function is displayed. If the user turns on this feature, the Z-score value follows the theory below.\nThe newborn can be classified according to the duration of the mother's pregnancy, the child's birth weight and length. Three groups are distinguished by percentile based on SGA, AGA, LGA. SGA - malnourished relative to gestational age, AGA - well-nourished relative to gestational age, LGA - overfed relative to gestational age. If the child is below the 10th percentile relative to a given week, it will be classified as malnourished relative to the duration of the pregnancy. If it is above the 90th percentile relative to a given week, it will be classified as overfed relative to the duration of the pregnancy. Furthermore, if the child’s birth weight is between the 10th percentile and the 90th percentile, it will be classified into a normal nutritional group relative to the duration of pregnancy. For this reason, if the user turns on this feature, we can observe smaller differences between the NKI Z-scores, as it calculates the Z-score with the mean and standard deviation of the given group in which the birth weight and based on the duration of pregnancy. Z-score value = (x - mean) / standard deviation, where x is the height, weight, measurement value of the given thing, and the others are the mean and standard deviation of the data related to a given time.",
